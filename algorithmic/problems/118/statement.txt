Guess the Number

This is an interactive problem.

Alice has an integer y in the range [1, 10^18], and Bob wants to find out this number.
Each time Bob picks an integer x in the range [0, 10^18] and asks Alice.
- If y > x, Alice returns 2.
- If y = x, Alice returns 1.
- If y < x, Alice returns 0.

However, Eve has intercepted all communication between Alice and Bob.
Eve uses a pseudo-random number generator:

    const long long P = 998244353; // Not necessarily this number.
    const int n = 3; // Not necessarily this number.
    long long seed = 233; // Even more uncertain.
    int gen()
    {
        seed = seed * n % P;
        return seed % n;
    }

Each time Alice returns a value a, Eve generates a random number b using this generator
and returns to Bob the value a xor b (bitwise XOR, i.e. ^ in C++).

You are Bob, and you have somehow obtained P and n, but you do not know seed.
You need to find y within 100 queries.

### Implementation Details

The first line of input contains two integers subtask_id and T.
  - `subtask_id`: current subtask ID.
  - `T`: number of test cases.

In each of the T test cases, the first line of input contains two integers P and n.
  - P and n from Eve’s PRNG.

Then, you may start interacting with the interactor.

You may issue queries by writing to standard output lines of the form 

    ? x

- You must ensure 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.
- The return value is already XOR’ed by Eve.

You must also make a guess exactly once of the form

    ! y

Example:
0 1
998244353 3 332748118 3

Possible interaction:
init(0,1)
solve(998244353,3)
query(4) -> returns 1
query(2) -> returns 2
query(3) -> returns 1
=> Answer is 3.

### Scoring

Let Q be number of calls to `query`, S be the score of this subtask:
- If Q > Q_max, score = 0.
- If Q_min < Q <= Q_max, score = S * (1 - 0.7 * (Q - Q_min) / (Q_max - Q_min)).
- If Q <= Q_min, score = S.

### Constraints

- 10^3 ≤ P ≤ 10^18; 3 ≤ n ≤ 4; 0 ≤ seed < P; T ≤ 100
- Qmin = 100, Qmax = 200
- P is guaranteed to be prime.
