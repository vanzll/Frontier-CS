LLM as Reward Designer - CartPole
=================================

Environment: CartPole-v1
------------------------
A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart.

Dynamics (Implicit)
-------------------
You can infer the dynamics from the standard physics of a pendulum on a cart.
State: `[x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot]`
Action: `0` (Left), `1` (Right)

Goal
----
Design a `reward_function(state, action, next_state, done)` to help PPO learn to keep the pole upright.
Ground Truth Reward: +1 for every step the pole remains upright.
